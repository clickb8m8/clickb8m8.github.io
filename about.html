      This is a site where you can scratch that clickbait itch without guilty about giving money to those who plague the internet with search engine destroying articles that are bloated with ads. The developer of this site actually recommends using adblock for many reasons. All profits made will go to getting through college, and then the site will be archived and deleted (so you can still see them if you want to, but it will not ruin your search results).
