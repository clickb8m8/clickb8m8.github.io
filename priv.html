    <p>The only js we use on this site is to encourage sharing articles. Cookies are not used, and this is all served as static text. With that being said there is no personal information we collect. Sharing articles to a third parties site may give information about your use of this site to that third party, hence that site's policy should be observed as well. This includes whatever ad service I am running as I honestly don't know what they do, and frankly I find it disturbing that blocking ads isn't the norm.</p>
