    <p id="title">Life Hack 5: How to pass <b>any</b> class!</p>
    <p>If you are like me you are not an egg head. Here is a complete list of what I do in every class, and I've passed them all so like probably at least one of them is working some sort of magic.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Laf at all of your teachers jokes <b>hard</b>.</li>
	<p>Teaching is the job you take if you fail stand up. Teachers will usually reward you for giving them false hope at another shot of being a comidian.</p>
      <li>Get a friend to buy you the book for the class.</li>
      <p>Lots of good stuff in there, but I didn't really read it. Brinign it to class usually gives the instructor the impression that you can read, hence will bump you in the curve.</p>
      <li>Pretend you like your instructor.</li>
      <li>Show up to tests.</li>
      <p>Ok. So you can't skip everyday, but tests are a big portion of that grade. Don't evern write your name. There will undoubtably be some smarty pants who forgets their own name (not so smart now huh?). When the instructor asks who it is then claim it's yours.</p>
      <li>"I get it now"</li>
      <p>Nothing makes a teacher feel like they are worth something than teaching someone cooler than him some liberal ideas. Pretend like their teaching style really helped you learn and only they could make the material click, especially if you don't get anything.</p>
    </ol>
