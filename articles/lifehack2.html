    <p id="title">Life Hack 2: Shopping with yo homie</p>
    <p>We all know the feel. Going shoping with someone is awful, because they will ask you to carry stuff. Not only is shopping boring, but also you now can't look at your phone. Well here is a life hack for just this thing. Use your mouth to bite onto the handles of a bag. This frees up a hand to do anything, <b>anything.</b> You can text, talk, fidget spin, play video games, record video, dribble a basket ball, you get the picture. This can work for multiple bags as well as long as they do not get too heavy.</p><br><br>
    <p>But you get to your car, what now? No fear, use your foot, or a finger, to open the door handle. Put in the bag in your hand first. Then use the hand you just freed to grab the bag in your mouth and do the same. Congrats dude, you just went shopping without ever having to put your phone down.</p>
