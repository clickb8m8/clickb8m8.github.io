    <p id="title">YOUR BODY COULD BE 70% OF THIS DANGEROUS CHEMICAL</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Dihydrogen monoxide. Scary name right? the human body does a lot that gets rid of this chemical. you urinate it, sweat it, and even sneeze it out, yet it still is in your system. this chemical is pretty much everywhere and it can be impossible to get rid of. all drinking water contains this chemical, its in our brains and blood, it covers our streets when it rains, and it can even be in the air we breath. our bodies try so hard to get this chemical out, and if you have too much if it then your body may even cause you to start vomiting. there are thousands of deaths each year caused by it.<br><br>
      so what can you do to decrease the amount of dihydrogen monoxide in your system? some say a high sodium diet is key to reducing this chemical in your system. so eat that bag of chips. it could save your life. in a small study, our team either drank a full milk jug of this chemical (about a gallon) or shared a bag of potato chips. the chips peope enjoyed the test and actually wanted more. those who had the chemical grew sick, <b>violently</b>. They could not stop throwing up, and one even passed out. from this study it can safely be said that too much of this chemical is not a good thing.<br><br>
      but how did this happen? science people call this hyperhydration. the brain loses its ability to function properly after electrolytes are no longer balanced. having too much of this chemical can also lead to hyponatremia as it begins to impact your blood too much. This causes people to have siezures, like in those doctor shows, comas, or even headaches.<br><br>
      please share to inform your friends about the dangers of this chemical.
