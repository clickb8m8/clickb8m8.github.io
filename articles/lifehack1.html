    <p id="title">Life Hack 1: Seatbelts</p>
    <p>You may have seen a wierd looking strap thing in your car. This is called a seat belt. The wierd thing that sits next to your butt is where it hooks into. If you wrap it around your body it can save your life if you crash your car while driving. You don't even have to be driving since the seatbelt keeps you in your car if a crash occurs, and a crash may occur if you are just in your car but not even driving. Most mortocycles do not have this feature, so an accident with one at 100KPH will probably kill you.</p>
