      do you eat kiwis? do you like them? well u r in luck. we all love kiwis, so if you answered no to one of those questions you are wrong and r in luck anyway. Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi) or Chinese gooseberry is the name given to the edible berries of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia. it gets its name from looking like a bird egg (also called the kiwi, woops scientists). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds (keep this in mind for later, it's important). the fruit has a soft texture and a sweet but unique flavor. it is a commercial crop in several countries, such as Italy, or the united states if you go to your grocery store.

      You can also slice kiwi's. mmmmnnnmmmmm. go to any wedding and boom, kiwi. go to any prom, boom, kiwi. go to your asian friend's house, boom, kiwi. kiwis are everywhere and they should be. but why have we forsaken them?

      kiwis have been invented by god herself, but she does not want to tell people they've been using her invention wrong. sad really. imagine creating a fruit that humorously looks like a ball sack, and most people get the joke but miss the intended use. it's like giving your not too bright friend a car and they use the engine as a stove. because you don't want to embarrass them you don't tell them. this also could explain the absence of god in countries that do not get technology quite yet.

      here is a video of some dude doing it the right way! all at once. you have got to see this. science guys believe that eating it like so is better for your health since the peel is good for your hair. this is due to the high hair content located on the outer peel. notice the guy has a beard. this shows the correlation between kiwi intake and being one with the inner goat (because it is a scientific fact that goats have beards!).
