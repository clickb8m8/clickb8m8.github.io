      <li>he's always low on condoms</li>
      your boyfriend spends more on these than he will for the wedding and divorce <b>combind</b>. if he runs out that means there are, on average, at least seven other women, or men, he is sleeping with. one test you can do to be sure is to buy some for him. if he doesn't use them right away then he may be saving them for someone later.
      <li>she is in a good mood all month long</li>
	she missed her period? you may think this is good, but it actually means she may be pregnant. there is no way to know for sure without her pee. place a pregnancy test in your toilet. come back later. if she asks why you have it in the toilet you have something to be concerned about. 
      <li>they pass gas in front of you</li>
	gross, nuff said.
      <li>his browsing history is kind of short considering how long he's at the computer</li>
      cheating with your eyes is very common in men. porn not only allows this, but is also a gateway cheating to sex cheating. one thing they often forget though, is the history on their phone. if you can't get the phone's password then just take out its sim card and put it in your phone (hacker secret). the history will be transfered and you can look at it then.
      <li>her browsing history is kind of short considering how long she's at the computer</li>
      cheating with your eyes is very common in women. porn not only allows this, but is also a gateway cheating to sex cheating. one thing they often forget though, is the history on their phone. if you can't get the phone's password then just take out its sim card and put it in your phone (hacker secret). the history will be transfered and you can look at it then.
      <li>she doesn't stay in the kitchen</li>
	where else is she going, hmm? maybe she goes to the mall without you. that is a little less worrysome, but if she claims to have a job you need to take that with a grain of salt <b>and pepper</b>. she may just be using this as an excuse to have sex with another gal or guy 8 hours a day, can you keep it up that long?
    </ol>
    <p>and the number one most common way to tell if (s)he is cheating on you is visible if you share this page.</p>

    <div class="share"></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>They change their relationship status to "it's complicated". This is common among cheaters as a roasting method. I mean, you have to be stupid to miss it right? not always. if your partner will not give you his/her facebook password to let you unblock yourself from them then it may be too late.</p>
