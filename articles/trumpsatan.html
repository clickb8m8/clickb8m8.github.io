    <p>In the picture above you can see trump, also known as american jesus, holding some magic ball with two other men. Duderonii 18:9-12 says that this type of witchcraft is <b>bad</b>, and may even be <i>satanic</i>. Speaking of satanic acts with other men, trump seems awfully well dressed for a straight guy. I wonder what else he's hiding. hmmmmmmm. well don't worry, I figured it out.<br>
      this dimly lit place resumbles hell. All illuminatie initiation rituals must take place in hell so that they can hide from god that they are up to no good. the ball is actually the illuminudty eye that they are all poking as the three stooges would. speaking of three stooges, the reason three men must be up there is because there are 180 degrees in a triagnle in a euclidean plane. 180/3=60 degrees which makes the room a cool but tolerable temperature assuming american fair in height.</p><br>
    <p>For more information I turned to illumaxnatie expert Luigi. Here is what he had to say:</p><br>
