    <p id="title">SNOWFLAKE LEFTERALS CAN NOT MEME</p>
    <p>We all know this time of year folks. Kernel ku klucken (KKK) losed his country music award to someone liberal pop singers instead. Good country has left (pun not indtended) the building #LynchJasonDerulo.</p>

    <p>most of his negative reviews came from babie libtards who poop their diapers (no I'm not projecting a fetish for the last time). they say he's racist, but they elected obama. Nothing's more racist than that poopy monkey. if he went for a third term then we'd all be doomed to white slavery and free healthcare. thank the good god above that trump (the second coming, just you wait and see) came to undo what evils obama has done #sin.</p><br>

    <p>Anywho, the KKK says he not racist so eat a pipe bomb libtards. He even made a post on twitter saying that he didn't run over any BLM protesters yet. So all your memes are wrong so checkmate. That's all there is. The KKK has won #KeepinItCountry #SouthSide. I mean the fact that I don't think an image you put text on the internet is funny means I won. Do the world a favor and leave. I just can't stand all this hate for KKK, and Trump. Sorry yall, I'm just done here.</p>
